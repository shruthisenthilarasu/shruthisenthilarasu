# Hello, Hello :)

## Hi, I'm Shruthi

I build and write with intention, where practical software meets real human needs. My work is grounded in clarity, utility, and an awareness of how systems behave in the world — especially where those behaviors intersect with people's lived experiences.

I care about how systems fail, how people experience those failures, and how tooling can reduce friction instead of adding to it.
