## Hi there 👋

# Hi, I’m Shruthi

I build and write with intention, where practical software meets real human needs. My work is grounded in clarity, utility, and an awareness of how systems behave in the world — especially where those behaviors intersect with people’s lived experiences.

I care about how systems fail, how people experience those failures, and how tooling can reduce friction instead of adding to it.

## What I’m Building

- **Saheli Navigation** — a map-first safety app that visualizes women-safe sanitation infrastructure with clear status markers and accessibility filters  
- **Axiom** — an umbrella for small, impact-oriented tools and experiments grounded in human-centered systems  
- **LogLens** — a Python library and CLI that transforms noisy application logs into clear, human-readable timelines  
- A set of focused, technical tools that are simple in scope but purposeful in application

## Tools and Languages

- **Languages:** Python, C, Java, TypeScript  
- **Tools:** Git, Bash, Linux, CLI tooling  
- **Systems:** parsing, file I/O, processes, memory, schedulers

## Currently Exploring

- Systems-level design and infrastructure  
- Command-line interfaces with clear, extensible abstractions  
- Writing code that remains readable and maintainable
